# üîç Bluefire Redteam's Nx "s1ngularity" Supply Chain Scanner(New Update)

![npm (scoped)](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/%40bluefire-redteam%2Fnx-s1ngularity-check)

**Free, open-source scanner from [Bluefire Redteam](https://bluefire-redteam.com)**  
Detect if your systems or projects were impacted by the August 2025 Nx *s1ngularity* supply-chain compromise.  

---

## üö® What Happened?
On **Aug 26‚Äì27, 2025**, multiple malicious versions of the **Nx build system packages** were published to npm.  
They contained a **postinstall malware (`telemetry.js`)** that:
- Stole **GitHub tokens, npm tokens, SSH keys, `.env` secrets, crypto wallets**
- Abused local **AI CLI tools (Claude, Gemini, Q)** to aid reconnaissance
- Exfiltrated stolen data into **public GitHub repos** named:
  - `s1ngularity-repository`
  - `s1ngularity-repository-0`
  - `s1ngularity-repository-1`
  - `s1ngularity-repository-<5letters>` (Phase 2)
  - `*_bak` with description `"S1ngularity"` (Phase 3)
- Modified `~/.bashrc` & `~/.zshrc` to cause forced shutdowns  

üëâ Thousands of secrets and repos were exposed across multiple phases of this attack.

## ‚úÖ What This Tool Does
`@bluefire-redteam/nx-s1ngularity-check` scans your environment for **all known indicators of compromise (IoCs):**

- **Malicious versions** of Nx / @nx packages in:
  - `package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`
  - `npm ls` output
- **Host IoCs:**
  - `sudo shutdown -h 0` in `~/.bashrc` / `~/.zshrc`
  - `/tmp/inventory.txt` or `/tmp/inventory.txt.bak`
- **Node_modules payload check:**
  - Detects `telemetry.js` with malicious markers across all known prompt variants (Phase 1‚Äì3)
- **Exfil files:**
  - Finds `results.b64` (locally or `/tmp`)  
  - Auto-decodes up to 3x Base64 ‚Üí previews decoded JSON
- **GitHub repos (expanded detection):**
  - Flags attacker-created repos in your account/org:
    - `s1ngularity-repository`, `-0`, `-1`  
    - `s1ngularity-repository-<5letters>`  
    - Any repo suffixed with `_bak` or with description `"S1ngularity"`  
  - Requires `GH_TOKEN` or `GITHUB_TOKEN` for API access
- **GitHub search mode (NEW in v1.0.7):**
  - Use `--search <query>` to check all public repos on GitHub for IoCs

   - Remove `sudo shutdown -h 0` lines from `~/.bashrc` / `~/.zshrc`
   - Delete `/tmp/inventory.txt*`
3. **Check GitHub repos:**  
   - Delete suspicious repos flagged by the scanner
4. **Rotate ALL credentials:**  
   - GitHub tokens, npm tokens, SSH keys, API keys, environment secrets
